## 1. Overview

The `services` folder is a crucial part of the PNC Financials React app, responsible for handling communication with external services, managing data retrieval and updates, and performing various backend operations required for the application's functionality.

## 2. Available Services

Within this folder, you'll find a collection of service modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's interaction with external resources. These services are organized based on their functionality, making it easy to locate and maintain code related to specific features.

Common services you may find include:

- **AuthenticationService**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **DataService**: Manages data retrieval and storage.
- **PaymentService**: Supports payment processing.
- **NotificationService**: Manages notifications and alerts.

Please refer to the specific service's documentation or code comments for more detailed information on how they work and how to use them.

## 3. API Endpoints

The services in this folder often interact with external APIs or server endpoints to fetch or update data. These API endpoints should be documented within the respective service files or in a centralized API documentation file if applicable. Make sure to maintain this documentation to ensure the smooth operation of the app.

## 4. Service Configuration

Service configuration, such as API keys, endpoints, and environment-specific settings, should be managed separately, preferably through environment variables or a configuration management system. Ensure that these configurations are appropriately secured and never hard-coded in the service files.

## 5. Contributing

We welcome contributions from the developer community to improve and enhance the functionality of the `services` folder. If you wish to contribute, please follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards and practices.

## 6. License

The code within this `services` folder is subject to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) associated with the PNC Financials React app. Please review the license terms and conditions before using or distributing any code from this folder.
