## Overview

The `src` folder contains the source code for the PNC Financials React App. This folder is organized into several subdirectories to maintain a clean and modular codebase. Below is a brief description of each subdirectory:

## Components

The `components` directory houses all the reusable UI components used throughout the application. Each component is organized into its own folder, containing the component file, styles (if applicable), and any associated assets. This separation allows for easy maintenance and reusability.

## Styles

The `styles` directory contains global styles, themes, and CSS modules used to style the components. CSS files are organized in a modular fashion to keep the styles scoped to the components they belong to. The global styles are used for application-wide styling and theming.

## Contexts

The `contexts` directory includes React context providers that manage global state and data for the application. These contexts help maintain application-wide state and provide data to various components without the need for prop drilling.

## Services

The `services` directory contains modules responsible for making API requests and handling data retrieval from external sources or APIs. Services help keep data fetching logic separate from the components, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## Utils

The `utils` directory holds utility functions and helper modules used across the application. These functions can encompass anything from date formatting to validation and should be easily accessible for various parts of the codebase.

## Hooks

The `hooks` directory is where custom React hooks are stored. These hooks encapsulate reusable pieces of logic that can be shared among different components. They promote code reusability and maintainability.

## Assets

The `assets` directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other files used within the application. These assets are typically imported into components or stylesheets as needed.

Please refer to specific subdirectories or files for more detailed information about their contents and functionality. Remember to maintain clean and consistent coding practices, follow our coding standards, and document your code for easier collaboration and future maintenance.

Happy coding!
