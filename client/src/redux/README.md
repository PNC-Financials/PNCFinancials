## Introduction

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps us manage the application's state in a predictable and centralized manner.

## Redux in PNC Financials

In the PNC Financials React application, Redux is used to handle various aspects of state management, such as user authentication, transaction data, and more. This folder contains all the Redux-related code for the project.

## Redux Folder Structure

The folder structure within the Redux folder is organized to keep different Redux-related modules separate for better maintainability. While this readme won't detail the folder structure or getting started instructions, you can explore the code to understand how it's organized.

## Reducers

Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. They define how the state is updated based on the actions dispatched to the Redux store. The reducer files in this folder describe how various parts of the application's state are managed.

## Actions

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe the type of action that occurred and any necessary payload data. The action files in this folder define the types of actions that can occur within the application.

## Selectors

Selectors are utility functions used to extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store. They provide a way to access the application's state in a structured and efficient manner. The selector files in this folder contain functions to retrieve data from the Redux store.

## Middleware

Middleware is a way to extend Redux's capabilities by adding custom logic between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Middleware files in this folder may contain code for handling async actions, logging, or other custom functionality.

## Store

The store is the heart of Redux, where the application's state is held. The store configuration is typically found in this folder, including the root reducer setup, middleware configuration, and any initial state.

## Usage

To understand how Redux is used in the PNC Financials React application, you should explore the code within this folder. Pay attention to the actions, reducers, selectors, middleware, and store configuration to get a complete picture of how Redux is integrated.
