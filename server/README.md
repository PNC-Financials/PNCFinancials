## Introduction

The "server" folder contains the backend code for the PNC Financials React app. It handles data retrieval, authentication, and other server-side tasks to support the frontend.

## Server Components

The server folder contains various components and modules, including:

- **Controllers**: Controllers define the behavior of your API endpoints. They handle incoming requests and send responses back to clients.

- **Models**: Models define the structure of the data stored in the database. These models are used by the server to interact with the database.

- **Routes**: Routes define the endpoints and their associated controllers. They specify the API's URL structure and the functions to execute when a request is made to a specific endpoint.

- **Middlewares**: Middleware functions can be used to add custom logic to the request-response cycle. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or validation.

- **Utils**: This folder may contain utility functions and helper modules used throughout the server code.

## Configuration

The configuration files are essential for setting up your server. They typically include settings for the database connection, authentication, and any environment-specific variables. Make sure to configure these files according to your deployment environment.

## API Endpoints

The server provides various API endpoints that the React app communicates with. These endpoints handle actions such as user registration, login, fetching financial data, and more. Refer to the relevant route files and controllers to understand the available API endpoints and their functionality.

## Authentication

Authentication is a crucial part of the server. It ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources. The server may use various authentication mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or session-based authentication. Check the authentication-related files for more details on how it is implemented.

## Database

The server interacts with a database to store and retrieve data. The choice of database system may vary, but common options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. The database schema and models are defined in the "models" folder, and database connections are configured in the configuration files.

## Logging

Logging is essential for monitoring and debugging the server. It helps track errors, record user activities, and maintain system health. The server may use logging libraries or custom logging solutions. Check the logging configuration to understand where and how logs are generated.

## Testing

Testing is crucial to ensure the reliability of the server. It typically involves unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. You may find testing scripts and configuration files in this folder. Proper testing helps identify and fix issues before they reach production.
