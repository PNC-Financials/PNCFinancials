## Getting Started

Before you begin styling images with CSS, make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. You should have an HTML document with one or more images that you want to style.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
</body>
</html>
```

## Basic Image Styling

### Adding a Border

You can add a border to an image using the `border` property in CSS:

```css
img {
    border: 2px solid #333;
}
```

### Setting Margins and Padding

Use the `margin` and `padding` properties to control the spacing around the image:

```css
img {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 5px;
}
```

## Image Size and Scaling

### Setting Width and Height

To specify the width and height of an image, use the `width` and `height` properties:

```css
img {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

### Controlling Image Scaling

To prevent images from scaling beyond their original dimensions, use the `max-width` and `max-height` properties:

```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
}
```

## Image Alignment

### Centering an Image

To center an image horizontally within its container, you can use the `margin` property with `auto` values:

```css
img {
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## Image Filters

### Applying Grayscale

You can make an image grayscale using the `filter` property:

```css
img {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
}
```

## Image Transitions

### Adding Hover Transitions

To create smooth transitions when hovering over an image, use the `transition` property:

```css
img {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

## Image Hover Effects

### Creating Hover Effects

You can apply various hover effects using CSS. For example, changing opacity:

```css
img:hover {
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

## Image Sprites

### Using Image Sprites

Image sprites combine multiple images into a single file to reduce server requests. To display a specific part of the sprite, adjust the `background` and `background-position` properties:

```css
.sprite {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-image: url('sprites.png');
    background-position: -100px -50px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

## Responsive Images

### Making Images Responsive

To make images responsive to different screen sizes, use the `max-width: 100%;` property:

```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```
